# PAN Power

This is a collection of scripts I have made to help me manage, configure, and explorer Palo Alto Networks Products

## License

This project is licensed under the Apache License Version 2.0 - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details
A lot of the ideas and structure in this comes from emulating pan-python with their license https://github.com/kevinsteves/pan-python/blob/master/LICENSE.txt [LICENSE-PANPYTHON](LICENSE-PANPYTHON)

## Acknowledgments

* PAN python was the base for many of the ideas as well as the API browser and "debug cli on"
* I did use many google searches and ideas from blogs and "Hey, Scripting Guy!"
* Inspiration also came from colleagues including James Castello, Scot Hargan, Jason Coleman
* Also inspired by classes and conversations at ignite and PS Summit
* Google led me to brianaddicks a lot https://github.com/brianaddicks/PowerAlto, but his looks more like VMware Power-CLI and this is more generic like pan-py
